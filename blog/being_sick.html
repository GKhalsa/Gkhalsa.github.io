        <div class="scrollBox"><h3>What a compromised body taught me about productivity</h3>It was Sunday, just any old Sunday except for this scratchy acid feeling at the back of my throat. I was a bit more tired than usual, but I chalked it up to staying out late the day previous. What I didn't think was going to happen was undergo a sickness that would seriously kick my ass.<br/><br/>

        The kicker was that it was the end of a module and the team projects were coming in. I just simply couldn't afford to be sick right now, but my body didn't really give a shit. It just wanted me to sleep and get better, but I had to get things done.<br/><br/>

        It became apparent immediately that I had about 8 good hours a day(including school) before my body would start shutting down. How would I get all the work I needed to get done where before I was staying here to 10pm-11pm and now I couldn't keep my eyes open past 6pm.<br/><br/>

        The answer was to use the time I had in the best way possible. No more talking, no more hanging out, just strickly work.<br/><br/>

        I began to realize that I was getting more work done than I thought, in fact way more work than I could do previously in a better state of health. This was odd. I'm leaving at 6 instead of 11, my brain is working slower, how is 1 + 1 = 3.<br/><br/>

        The answwer was actually quite simple. Talking and procrastinating takes away a shitload of time. In fact it becomes a vicious cycle when you need to stay up later in order to get the work done. When you go to bed later, you are a bit more grogy in the morning. It takes a bit more time to get back into the flow.. causing you to then stay up later. Having this sickness forcing me to think about the prcious time that I had gave me the best of both worlds. I was determined to focus and I was going to sleep earlier. Vwala, good work habits.
